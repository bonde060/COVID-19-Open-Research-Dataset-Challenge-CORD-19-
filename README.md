# ML Challenge COVID-19
Dataset and challenge provided by Kaggle, my effort at solving. Dataset available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge?resource=download

Uses k-means clustering to group articles by similar topics. Over 20GB of data grouped comprehensively. 

Demonstrates data pre-processing to clean the research articles, data mining to extract main text, NLP to draw keywords, and RandomForest to verify the clustering. 

Uses two attempts to create features: 
- hashingVector
- tf-idf vectorizing

Finished clusters presented in interactive plot that can be searched.
